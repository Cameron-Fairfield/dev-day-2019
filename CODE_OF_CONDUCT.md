RStudio supports the [Diversity Charter](https://diversitycharter.org/) for

and encourage the diversity of the R community, with participants who represent
various points on the spectrums of race, color, national origin, religion,
sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, abilities, wealth, language,
and politics.

We expect everyone at tidyverse developer day to contribute to a welcoming,
civil, safe, and tolerant environment. RStudio and the tidyverse team are
committed to fostering a productive, harassment-free experience for everyone. We
do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

At tidyverse developer day:

 * Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.  
 * If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event.
