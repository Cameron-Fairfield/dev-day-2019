# Tidyverse developer day 2019

### Save the date ðŸ“†

On the Saturday following [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/), we'll be holding our first ever **tidyverse developer day**. 

* Where: [The Sunset Room](https://www.sunsetroomaustin.com/), just a couple blocks away from where rstudio::conf is being held.

* When: January 19th, 9am-4pm.

* Who: Anyone who would like to get better at contributing to the tidyverse! Everyone is welcome regardless of whether you've never done a PR before, or if you've already made your 10th package. We'll also host some discussions about future development plans for tidymodels.

* What: A day of learning and coding. We'll provide breakfast, lunch, snacks, and coffee; you'll bring your laptop and enthusiasm. The tidyverse team will be on hand to help out and answer your questions.

### Squad goals ðŸŽ¯

The broad goal of this event is to nurture regular contributors to the tidyverse by 
having a day where we can work together on anything ranging from submitting your 
first pull request, to working on a package. The tidyverse team will be there, 
so we can help you hit the ground running and/or get over any stumbling blocks that 
you encounter. Don't have any ideas for something to work on? No problem! We'll 
be tagging issues in advance to make sure there's lots to do for any- and 
everyone, regardless of level of expertise.
