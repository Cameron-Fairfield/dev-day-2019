# Tidyverse developer day 2019

### Save the date ðŸ“†

On the Saturday following [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) (**January 19th**), 
we'll be holding our first ever **tidyverse developer day**. The event will 
go from **9am - 4pm**, to allow time for those who need to catch evening flights.
The venue is not settled yet, but the intent is to make it convenient for 
people whoâ€™ve chosen lodging based on the rstudio::conf location. However, 
if you're in Austin and want to join, you're more than welcome regardless of 
whether or not you attended rstudio::conf.



### Squad goals ðŸŽ¯

The broad goal of this event is to nurture regular contributors to the tidyverse by 
having a day where we can work together on anything ranging from submitting your 
first pull request, to working on a package. The tidyverse team will be there, 
so we can help you hit the ground running and/or get over any stumbling blocks that 
you encounter. Don't have any ideas for something to work on? No problem! We'll 
be tagging issues in advance to make sure there's lots to do for any- and 
everyone, regardless of level of expertise.

### Tickets ðŸŽŸ

Because space is limited, we'll be charging a $10 fee of for 
[tickets](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tidyverse-developer-day-tickets-1617065687),
all of which will be donated to charity ([Code2College](https://code2college.org/about/)).
